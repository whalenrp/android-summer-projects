Project 1 - File Browser

This project is intended to introduce intents, activities, and indirectly
the UNIX filestructure. 

Requirements:
1) Folders must be visually distinguishable from files. 
2) By tapping on a folder, the underlying ArrayList should be modified to 
reflect the contents of the selected directory.
3) The back button must be overriden to take the user up a directory, and out
of the application if the user is at the root directory.
4) When the user clicks on a file, an intent to start a new activity with the 
appropriate applications should launch. At the current moment, this project 
launches only text files since the emulator doesn't come with media files on it.
